This large battery case (LBC) add-on is compatible with the P3 and P4 revisions of RGB Touch Mini.

#### 3D Print settings

- **Orientation** Bottom on build plate
- **Filament** Any
- **Perimeters/walls** 4 or more
- **Top/Bottom Layers** 4 or more
- **Supports** None
- **Brim** As required - I print No Brim.

##### What else do I need to use this?
To use this on your RGB Touch Mini, you will need to source 4x 10mm M2.5 screws to replace the 4x 5mm M2.5 screws in the corners of the case.

**NOTE** Do not use screws longer than 10mm or you may damage the SMT nuts they screw into or even the touch PCB.
